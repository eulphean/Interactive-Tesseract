# Interactive Tesseract
In 2020, Amay Kataria was invited to give a workshop as part of [DeConfine Festival](https://deconfine2020.org/). 8 students were selected from various art & design curriculums in India to attend this workshop and discuss their practice. The workshop went over the historical context of Fourth Dimension, provided an overview of SparkAR to create Augmented Reality projects and finally introduced the construction of a Tesseract to the students. Below is the prompt for the workshop. 

We perceive the world around us in a three dimensional way that can be visualized using the concept of width, height, and depth. However, mathematically there may be many more dimensions of space that are beyond our ability to perceive. One such object that lies in the fourth dimensional space is called Tesseract. In this session, we utilize simple techniques to deconstruct and visualize the spatial properties of the Tesseract in three dimensional space. Consequently, we use this idea of extrapolating spatial perspectives as a metaphor to devise new situations, interventions, associations, and experimental narratives using any medium that the participants may like. 

This seminar will span over two days, where each session will last for three hours including a 10-15 minute break. On the first day, the facilitator will introduce the concept of Tesseract and walk the participants through some visual and spatial exercises to get familiar with this idea. The facilitator will also ask the participants to creatively apply this concept into their everyday lives and mine a personal intervention to discuss the next day. On the second day, every participant will present their ideas using the medium of their choice to engage in a cohesive group discussion.
